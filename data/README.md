Repository for data sets used in lectures and assignements.

Some data sets come from the
[The Data and Story Library](http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/DASL/). It is easy to
load them directly from R using a command like

    d <- read.table("http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/DASL/datafiles/filename.dat")

or

    d <- read.csv("http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/DASL/datafiles/filename.csv")


where `filename` is the name of the data set.
