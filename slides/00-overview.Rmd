This course is a short and practical introduction to statistical analysis of experimental data. 

* We will not cover mathematical statistics, but we will focus on **applied statistics**.
* We will not provide a complete account of statistical modeling.
* Examples will come from various disciplines: experimental psychology, medicine, biomedical engineering.
* We will try to emphasize the **interpretation of results**, and how to get them right.
