# Markdown

> Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML). -- John Gruber, 17 Dec 2004

## A minimalistic markup language

All tutorials in this course are written using Markdown, and they are available on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cogmaster-stats/r-cogstats).

[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is a simple yet elegant and fast markup language. Other alternatives include [reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html) or [asciidoc](http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/).

Other than its dedicated website, there are many [cheat sheets](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet) available on the internet, and we will only highlight the main features of the Md syntax.

There are other Md flavours, like [MultiMarkdown](http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/), and many text editors that support Md syntax and allow to generate HTML, PDF or MS Word document through [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/).

## Headers, lists, etc.

Like in HTML or word processing system, there are several levels of headers, which are prefixed by one or more `#`:

    # H1 level
    ## H2 level
    ### H3 level

Unordered (`<ul>`) and ordered (`<ol>`) lists are specified using `*` or `-`, and numbers, respectively:

    * item 1
    * item 2

    1. item 1
    2. item 2

---

They can be nested together, with appropriate spaces and CR, e.g.:

    1. item 1
      
      - item 1a
      - item 1b

    2. item 2
      
      - item 2a
      - item 2b

Line breaks are controlled by either a blank line (new paragraph, `<p>`) or a line ending with two spaces (`<br>`).

## Code chunks

Blocks of code (`<pre>`) or inline preformatted expression (`<pre>`) can be displayed in monospace font using paragraph indented using 4 spaces, or single back ticks, like in:

    This is an R function `f <- function(x) sum(is.na(x))`.

This is an R function `f <- function(x) sum(is.na(x))`. 

The corresponding block would read

    f <- function(x) sum(is.na(x))

---

It is also possible to use block delimited with three back ticks, with optional name for syntax highlighting. Here is an example using Python:

```python
from math import log

phi = (1 + 5**0.5) / 2

def fibinv(f):
    if f < 2:
        return f
    return int(round(log(f * 5**0.5) / log(phi)))
```


## Images

Images (PNG, JPG, etc.) can be displayed using the following syntax:

    ![alt](file.png)

**Example:**

![Md](./img/md_12pct.png)

Note that they will need to be resized beforehand.  
You can use [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org) or [GraphicsMagick](http://www.graphicsmagick.org) for that.

## Tables

This is a little bit trickier as we have to use Md syntax to format Tables, with a bit of CSS to enhance their rendering on screen.

A [sample Table](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet#tables) is given below:

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

## URLs

External references (`<a href="">`) are provided using inline- or reference-style links:

    [cogmaster-stats](https://github.com/cogmaster-stats/r-cogstats)
    
    [cogmaster-stats][1]
    [1]: https://github.com/cogmaster-stats/r-cogstats


[Inline links](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5319754/cross-reference-named-anchor-in-markdown) (`<a name="">`) links are also available.

# R Markdown

> R Markdown is an authoring format that enables easy creation of dynamic documents, presentations, and reports from R. <http://rstudio.com>

## What is R Markdown

<center>
R Markdown = Markdown syntax + dynamic R code
</center>
<br>

The Md syntax remains the same, but code chunks can be evaluated, silently or not, and results can be printed when generating the final output.

<code><pre>
‛‛‛{r, eval = 2:3, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 5, fig.align='center'}
set.seed(104)
x <- rnorm(1e6)
histogram(~ x)
‛‛‛
</pre></code>

RStudio facilitates the use of Markdown when performing statistical analysis; see their [tutorial](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com).

There is a minimal template on GitHub, [template.Rmd](https://github.com/cogmaster-stats/r-cogstats/blob/master/projects/template.Rmd).
