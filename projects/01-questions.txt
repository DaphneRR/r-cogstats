Using a knitr or Pweave custom report, you are asked to answer the following
questions:

1. (a) Give a numerical summary of sample size (frequencies and counts) and
   baby weight (mean, standard deviation and range) for each level of parity
   (0, 1, 2, 3+ siblings). Results should be printed in one or two
   Tables. (b) Use box-and-whiskers charts or density plots to show the
   distribution of individual weights.

2. (a) Does a one-way ANOVA suggest that the weights of babies are related
   to their parity? (b) What part of the variance is explained by this
   model? (c) Are usual assumptions met for such a model?

3. The reasearcher decides to aggregate the last two categories (2 and 3+
   siblings). Does that change conclusions raised in (2)?

4. Considering the same three levels for parity, is there any evidence of a
   linear trend between baby weights and number of siblings? Provide an
   effect-size measure and a p-value for the corresponding test.

5. (a) Compute pairwise Pearson correlation between baby weight, height, and
   head circumference, and report associated two-tailed significance tests,
   with and without Bonferroni correction. (b) Display all pairwise
   relationships in a scatterplot matrix or in separate scatter displays.

6. Using regression analysis, can we say that body length is a useful
   predictor for weight at 1 month of age? (a) Display the relationship
   between the two variables in a scatterplot, together with a loess
   smoother. Is there any evidence of local non-linearities in the cloud of
   points? (b) Provide a Table of regression coefficients, and (c)
   associated 95% confidence intervals for the slope parameter. (d) What is
   the R-squared value for this model? (e) What is the expected weight (in
   grams), with 95% confidence interval, for a baby whose height is 56.8 cm.
