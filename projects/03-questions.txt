Using a knitr or Pweave custom report, you are asked to answer the following
questions:

1. Create a new variable, DiffHR, whose values reflect the increase in heart
   rate after exercise compared to resting state.

2. (a) Give a numerical summary of increase in heart rate (mean, standard
   deviation and range) for each levels of Frequency and Height,
   separately. Factor levels will have to be recoded as described in the
   description file. Results should be printed in two Tables. (b) Perform
   the same numerical summary by considering the 6 treatments defined by
   crossing all factor levels together.

3. Use box-and-whiskers charts or density plots to show the distribution of
   individual increase in heart rate for each treatment.

4. Run a two-way ANOVA by considering increase in heart rate as the response
   variable and Frequency and Height as explanatory variables, with their
   interaction. (a) Use an interaction plot to summarize the main
   findings. (b) Is the interaction significant at the 5% level? (c) If not,
   summarize the effect of each factor (partial eta squared and p-value).

5. Write a custom contrast allowing the comparison of average increase in
   heart rate by considering the {slow + medium} (both combined)
   vs. fast/high levels Frequency of stepping, and report the results (t- or
   F-test with associated p-value and 95% confidence inetrvals).

6. (a) Write down the results obtained from linear regression model with
   heart rate (HR) as the response variable, and Frequency, Height, and
   baseline heart rate (RestHR) as explantory variable, in terms of: overall
   F-test and adjusted R-squared value for the whole model, estimates of
   slopes for the three explanatory variables and associated significance
   tests. (b) Compare those results with a two-way ANOVA similar to that
   fitted in (4) but without the interaction term: Do you reach similar
   conclusion about the main effects for the studied factors?
