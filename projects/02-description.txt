## Research question

The human estrogen receptor gene contains a two-allele restriction fragment
length polymorphism. Bands at 1.6 kb and/or 0.7 kb identify the genotype for
these alleles, and patients can be homozygous for the 1.6 kb (i.e., have two
copies of the same allele) or 0.7 kb pattern allele, or heterozygous (i.e.,
have one copy of each allele). Some authors studied the relationship between
this genotype and age of diagnosis among 59 breast cancer patients.

The main questions are:

1. Derive 95% confidence intervals for mean age at breast cancer diagnosis
   for each genotype.
2. Check whether the age at diagnosis does indeed vary with genotype.


## Loading data in R or Python

Individual data are available in the file 02-estrogen.txt. Instructions to
load this data set in R are given below. Note that genotype is coded as
follows: 1 = 1.6/1.6, 2 = 1.6/0.7, and 3 = 0.7/0.7.

> e <- read.table("02-estrogen.txt", header=TRUE)
> names(e)
[1] "id"       "age"      "genotype"
> str(e)
'data.frame':	59 obs. of  3 variables:
 $ id      : int  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...
 $ age     : int  43 47 55 57 61 63 63 69 70 72 ...
 $ genotype: int  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...

Using Python, with a working installation of Pandas, you can use the
following instructions:

>>> import pandas as pd
>>> e = pd.read_csv('02-estrogen.txt', sep=' ')
>>> e.head()
   id  age  genotype
0   1   43         1
1   2   47         1
2   3   55         1
3   4   57         1
4   5   61         1
