Using a knitr or Pweave custom report, you are asked to answer the following
questions:

1. (a) Give a numerical summary of sample size (frequencies and counts) and
   age at diagnosis (mean, standard deviation and range) for each genotype
   (recoded as a categorical variable with appropriate levels). Results
   should be printed in one or two Tables. (b) Use box-and-whiskers charts
   or density plots to show the distribution of individual ages.

2. Carry out a one-way ANOVA to test the null hypothesis that the age at
   breast cancer diagnosis does not depend on genotype. (a) Formulate your
   conclusion in plain English, and (b) report the percentage of explained
   variance.

3. Assuming equality of variances, the researchers reported the following
   95% confidence intervals (CI) for the three group means: 1.6/1.6
   [58.1;71.1], 1.6/0.7 [59.9;68.9], 0.7/0.7 [44.3;56.5]. Compute the same
   CIs without using a pooled estimate of the variance.

4. Compute all pairwise differences between group means, with their 95% CIs
   and p-values obtained from a parametric test for the observed
   difference. Does age at diagnosis differ between patients homozygous for
   the 1.6 allele and patients heterozygous?

5. (a) Let suppose there are some reasons to discard patients whose ID are:
   5, 6, 12, 13, 20, 28, 36, 39, 44, 51. What is the relative frequency of
   the genotype group they belong to? (b) Does that change the results of
   the ANOVA in (2)?

6. Compare results in (1) with those obtained from a Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA
   (kruskal.test() in R, or scipy.stats.mstats.kruskalwallis() in Python),
   which considers ranks instead of raw values for each observation.
