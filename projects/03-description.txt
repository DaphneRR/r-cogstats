## Research question

In this experiment, researchers were interested in the relationship between
subjects' heart rate after stepping exercise, based on differences in
stepping frequency and step height.

The main questions are:

1. Does Height and Frequency impact on increase in heart rate?
2. Are these two factors interacting together?
3. Is there specifically a difference between high frequency of stepping
   versus low or intermediate frequencies on the mean increase in heart
   rate? 


## Loading data in R or Python

Individual data are available in the file 03-stepping.dat. Instructions to
load this data set in R are given below. Block is a blocking variable
(subject and experimenter block ID), but it will not be considered
here. Variables labels are as follows:

- Height: 0 = low (5.7in), 1 = high (11.5in)
- Frequency: 0 = slow, 1 = medium, 2 = fast/high

Resting heart rate and heart rate after exercise are measured in beats per
minute.

> s <- read.table("03-stepping.dat", header=TRUE)
> names(s)
[1] "Order"     "Block"     "Height"    "Frequency" "RestHR"    "HR"
> str(s)
'data.frame':	30 obs. of  6 variables:
 $ Order    : int  16 18 19 21 25 17 20 22 23 27 ...
 $ Block    : int  2 2 2 2 2 4 4 4 4 4 ...
 $ Height   : int  0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 ...
 $ Frequency: int  0 1 2 0 2 1 0 0 2 2 ...
 $ RestHR   : int  60 63 69 69 69 96 87 90 93 87 ...
 $ HR       : int  75 84 135 108 93 141 120 99 153 129 ...

Using Python, with a working installation of Pandas, you can use the
following instructions:

>>> import pandas as pd
>>> s = pd.read_csv('03-stepping.dat', sep='\t')
>>> s.head()
    Order  Block  Height  Frequency  RestHR   HR
16      2      0       0        NaN      60   75
18      2      0       1        NaN      63   84
19      2      1       2        NaN      69  135
21      2      1       0        NaN      69  108
25      2      0       2        NaN      69   93
