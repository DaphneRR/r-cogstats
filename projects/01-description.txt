## Research question

In an obstetrics department, researchers are interested in the relationship
between baby weights one month after birth and several factors thought to
affect weight of a baby born at term. Among those factors, the number of
siblings (parity), gender, anthropometric characteristics (weight, height,
and head circumference), and parents' education level.

The main questions are:

1. Are the weights of babies related to their parity?
2. Is there an association between the weight, length and head circumference
   of 1-month old babies?
3. Can body length be used to predict weight at 1 month of age?


## Loading data in R or Python

Individual data are available in the file 01-weights.sav. Instructions to
load this data set in R are given below.

> library(foreign)
> w <- read.spss("~/Documents/Tutors/cesam-r/tex/data/weights.sav", to.data.frame=TRUE)
> names(w)
[1] "ID"       "WEIGHT"   "LENGTH"   "HEADC"    "GENDER"   "EDUCATIO" "PARITY"
> str(w)
'data.frame':	550 obs. of  7 variables:
 $ ID      : Factor w/ 550 levels "L001","L003",..: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...
 $ WEIGHT  : num  3.95 4.63 4.75 3.92 4.56 ...
 $ LENGTH  : num  55.5 57 56 56 55 51.5 56 57 58.5 52 ...
 $ HEADC   : num  37.5 38.5 38.5 39 39.5 34.5 38 39.7 39 38 ...
 $ GENDER  : Factor w/ 2 levels "Male","Female": 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 ...
 $ EDUCATIO: Factor w/ 3 levels "year10","year12",..: 3 3 2 3 1 3 1 1 3 1 ...
 $ PARITY  : Factor w/ 4 levels "Singleton","One sibling",..: 4 1 3 2 3 1 4 4 3 2 ...
 - attr(*, "variable.labels")= Named chr  "ID" "Weight (kg)" "Length (cms)" "Head circumference (cms)" ...
  ..- attr(*, "names")= chr  "ID" "WEIGHT" "LENGTH" "HEADC" ...

Should you want to use Python to carry out the analysis, here are samples
commands that can be used to load this data set. It requires a working
installation of Pandas, as well as rpy2 (http://rpy.sourceforge.net/rpy2.html). 

>>> import pandas.rpy.common as com
>>> filename = "01-weights.sav"
>>> w = com.robj.r('foreign::read.spss("%s", to.data.frame=TRUE)' % filename)
>>> w = com.convert_robj(w)
>>> w.head()
     ID  WEIGHT  LENGTH  HEADC  GENDER  EDUCATIO              PARITY
1  L001    3.95    55.5   37.5  Female  tertiary  3 or more siblings
2  L003    4.63    57.0   38.5  Female  tertiary           Singleton
3  L004    4.75    56.0   38.5    Male    year12          2 siblings
4  L005    3.92    56.0   39.0    Male  tertiary         One sibling
5  L006    4.56    55.0   39.5    Male    year10          2 siblings

If you have difficulty importing the SPSS data sheet, a CSV file is also
available. In this case, use the following instructions:

>>> import pandas as pd
>>> w = pd.read_csv('01-weights.csv')
