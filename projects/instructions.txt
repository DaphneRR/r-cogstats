Instructions for submitting projects

1. If you want to work with one or two colleagues, prepare a list with
   students' names (3 students max.); otherwise skip to step 2.

2. Pick one project, and relevant files on GitHub (or directly from the
   course website). For each project, there is a brief description of the
   data set and how to load data in R or Python, and a list of questions
   specific to that data set. 

3. Send an email to ch[dot]lalanne[at]gmail[dot]com with (a) your name, and
   the list of your coworkers if you're not alone, (b) the project you
   choose, and (c) the software you will be using.

4. Work on the project and try to address all questions using Python or R,
   but not both languages. Write your answer using one of the custom
   template (R Markdown or Pweave) that are available on GitHub. We don't
   need the output, just the *.Rmd or *.Pnw file. However, you will have to
   test your final report in order to ensure that results (Tables and
   Figures) are correctly printed in the HTML output file.

5. Submit your work by email to ch[dot]lalanne[at]gmail[dot]com before the
   deadline. 


In any case, you will be assessed on the quality of your report, the
accuracy of the results and of your responses. We expect correct and
reproducible R or Python code, nothing more.
