## Course organization
Here is a temptative schedule for the class. Each week, we will start with a
brief overview of statistical concepts, with illustration in R. This will be
followed by a one-hour hand-on practical, and occasional demonstration of
useful tools for data wrangling and reporting. Most statistical concepts
will be available in the following online textbook (hereafter, OpenIntroStat):

> Diez, DM, Barr, CD, and Çetinkaya-Rundel, M (2012). OpenIntro Statistics
> (Second Edition), <http://openintro.org>. 

Additional lectures will be given for topics not covered in the above
resource. You are encouraged to work at home, by reading the recommended
sections of this textbook, and try your best at the suggested homeworks.


## Time and place
This course will run from 8 Oct to 17 Dec, 2013 (10 sessions).  
Tuesday, 9:30-12:00  
45, rue d'Ulm, salle Becket


## Grading policy
There will be 3 or 4 assignments (50% of grade) and a final project
(50%). Assignments are due one week after announcement. All assignments
should be submitted in electronic format. No Word or Excel file will be
accepted.


## Lectures

1. **Working with data**  

    > data: what they are, how to collect them • simple random sampling •
    > observational studies and design of experiments


    This session will serve as an R starter or refresher, depending on your
	level. We will also discuss the use of RStudio. *Be sure to check that you
	have a working R installation.* 

    * **Reading:** OpenIntroStat 1.3-1.7
	* **Homework:** None

2. **Data management**

    > data manipulation • variable recoding • split-apply-combine • data
    > visualization • database • descriptive statistics

    We will continue learning R by manipulating data, creating convenient
    placeholder for curated data set, and providing univariate summary of
    data distribution. We will also learn how to install additional R
    packages
    ([Hmisc](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Hmisc/index.html) and
    [reshape2](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/reshape2/index.html)). If
    after this session you are still unsure about what you have learned
    regarding basic data manipulation in R, you are encouraged to complete
    the first 5 chapters on <http://tryr.codeschool.com> at home.

    * **Reading:** Tukey,

      Journal of Statistical Software (2011) 40(1).
    * **Homework:** 1-5

3. **Statistical inference, parametric estimation, resampling, power and effect size**  

    > what are models • principles and tools for statistical inference
    > (frequentist, likelihood, bayesian) • point and interval estimation (t-test,
    > binomial test and gaussian approximation) • bootstrap • statistical power •
    > effect size

    We will discuss statistical models, how to build an explanatory model,
    how (and why) to test it against an alternative model, and what's the
    purpose of parameter estimation. Beside null statistical hypothesis
    testing, we will also discuss power consideration and estimates of
    effect size.

    * **Reading:** OpenIntroStat 4.1-4.3, 4.6, 5.2-5.4; Lecoutre,
      B. [Et si vous étiez un bayésien qui s'ignore?](http://www.aliquote.org/cours/2013_AS/docs/Lecoutre2005.pdf)

    * **Homework:** 6-10
	
4. **Analysis of variance and design of experiments**  

    > one-way ANOVA • two-way ANOVA • interaction • post-hoc tests • contrasts •
    > factorial designs • blocking

    During this session, we will focus on specific experimental designs and
    the application of ANOVA to partition observed variance of a numerical
    response variable. We will learn how to control possible confounding
    effect, or what to do afterwards.

    * **Reading:** OpenIntroStat 5.5
    * **Homework:** 11-15
    * **Assignement 1**, due 12 Nov.
